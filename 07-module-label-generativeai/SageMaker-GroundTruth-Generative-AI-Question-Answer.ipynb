    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the process of setting up a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth's Question and Answer template. This labeling UI is designed to facilitate human annotators in reading a text passage and generating questions and answers to build a Q&A demonstration dataset. This UI supports customizable text input and flexible question-answer generation, with options to create questions referencing entire passages or highlight specific text portions for targeted Q&A. The color-coded matching feature visually links questions to relevant text sections, enhancing the annotation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this interface are to produce diverse, context-rich Q&A datasets that capture the nuances of human text comprehension, ultimately supporting the development of more sophisticated NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Common Use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improving chatbot and virtual assistant capabilities, ensuring they can understand and respond to customer queries accurately.\n",
    "2. Enhancing search engine question-answering features\n",
    "3. Creating educational content where models can assist in generating questions and answers for students based on reading materials.\n",
    "4. Assisting content creators in generating relevant questions and answers for articles, blogs, and other textual content.\n",
    "5. Supporting research in natural language understanding and generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps include  setting up necessary Ground Truth pre-requisites, downloading an input manifest JSON, creating a worker task template, creating and monitoring a labeling job, and post-processing the results to deliver a consolidated dataset with worker responses."

By combining the \"source\" data from the output manifest with the \"answers\" provided by workers, we create a unified view of all labeling tasks. This consolidation streamlines our data analysis process, allowing us to easily connect each task's original source with its corresponding worker annotations."
