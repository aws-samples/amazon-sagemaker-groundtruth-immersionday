Uniform Residential Loan Application
This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as "Borrower" or "Co-Borrower", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when
the income or assets of a person other than the "Borrower"
(including the Borrower's spouse) will be used as a basis for loan qualification or
the
income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person
has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property
state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.
If this is an application for joint credit, Borrower and Co-Borrower each agree that we intend to apply for joint credit (sign below):
